\section{Initial State}

In the initial state we keep track of the three Git trees: working copy, index
and head.  Moreover, we define relations for branches, tags and parent commits.

\begin{schema}{Repository}
	head: Commit \\
	index: Tree \\
	workingCopy: Tree \\
	branch: Name \pfun Commit \\
	tag: Name \pfun Commit \\
	parent: Commit \pfun \finset Commit
\end{schema}

The first two partial functions, $branch$ and $tag$, map a name to a
\texttt{Commit}.  The $parent$ function is in charge of tracking the repository
commits by associating each commit to a finite set of parent commits.
