\section{Free Type Definitions}

\subsection{FilePermission}

Using Unix permissions as a base, we define \texttt{FilePermission} as the valid
combinations of read, write, and execute permissions for owner, group or other.

\begin{zed}
  FilePermission ::= \\
  \t1 None | \\
  \t1 Read | \\
  \t1 ReadWrite | \\
  \t1 ReadWriteExecute | \\
  \t1 Write | \\
  \t1 WriteExecute | \\
  \t1 Execute
\end{zed}

\subsection{GitResponse}

We define \texttt{GitResponse} as the set of all the possible return codes
for the operations that will be presented in future sections.

\begin{zed}
  GitResponse ::= \\
  \t1 Ok | \\
  \t1 BranchAlreadyExists | \\
  \t1 TagAlreadyExists | \\
  \t1 NothingToCommit | \\
  \t1 CannotAdd | \\
  \t1 CommitNotInRepository
\end{zed}
