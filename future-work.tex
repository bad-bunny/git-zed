\section{Future Work}

Due to time constraints, we needed to limit the scope of the specification. We
decided to leave out features like remotes and automatic merge conflict
resolution at a very early stage of the specification. In addition, we later
decided to leave out operations like cherry pick, merge and rebase since these
require the calculation of tree differences and, in some cases, the selection of
paths using timestamp comparisons.
